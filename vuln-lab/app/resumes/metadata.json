To improve alignment, highlight hands-on experience with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, and cite any work with React/Angular/Vue.js. If you have worked on internal tools or web apps using Java or JS-based stacks, add concrete projects and metrics (e.g., performance improvements, user adoption, or security improvements). Emphasize cross-functional collaboration, Agile experience, and code reviews. Consider adding a Projects or Experience blurb that maps to the job responsibilities (designing, developing, and maintaining secure, scalable internal tools on AWS with MySQL). Also, confirm your US Person status or eligibility for GovCloud, and clearly state citizenship or permanent residency on the resume if applicable. Finally, quantify achievements where possible (e.g., reduced deployment time, improved security posture, or automated workflows) to strengthen impact.}\""
