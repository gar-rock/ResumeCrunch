    "recommendations": "Your resume demonstrates strong security leadership and relevant cloud/DevOps experience, but it lacks explicit full-stack development in Java/JavaScript and MySQL, which are key for this Keeper role. To improve fit: - Add a concise \u201cFull-Stack Experience\u201d section or bullets that show direct work with Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and a modern frontend framework (React/Angular/Vue). Include any MySQL or relational DB experience. - Highlight concrete, quantifiable outcomes from software development efforts (e.g., performance improvements, reduced defect rates, deployment speeds, security hardening metrics). - Reframe or add bullets that show collaboration with product managers, designers, and engineers in an agile environment, with code reviews and documentation. - Explicitly mention GovCloud eligibility or status (US Person) if applicable, since this is a compliance requirement. - Consider reorganizing to front-load relevant tech stack and project results, and add a few standalone projects or contributions that mirror Keeper\u2019s internal support tools and security-focused features. A targeted rewrite could convert security leadership into concrete full-stack product development impact that aligns with the job description."

    "recommendations": "Your resume shows solid security, cloud (AWS), and full-stack exposure with 9+ years of experience, which is valuable. However, it does not clearly demonstrate the explicit full-stack Java stack the role calls for (Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and a modern framework like React/Angular/Vue) or MySQL. To improve alignment with the Keeper Senior Software Engineer position, rewrite the resume to foreground: (1) direct full-stack development experience using Java and JavaScript, including any projects with React/Angular/Vue; (2) explicit MySQL database design/management work; (3) concrete, measurable outcomes from development work (e.g., performance improvements, reliability metrics, security incident reduction); (4) collaboration with product managers, designers, and cross-functional teams; (5) agile development experience and end-to-end ownership of features; (6) explicit mention of GovCloud/U.S. work eligibility if applicable. Add a concise summary at the top that maps your experience to Keeper\u2019s responsibilities (design, develop, and maintain secure, scalable support tools on AWS) and include certifications or trainings that support the role. Consider reorganizing to a more traditional full-stack format (Summary \u2192 Key Skills \u2192 Experience \u2192 Education) with bullet points that quantify impact. If you are a U.S. Person, explicitly note citizenship or work eligibility to address GovCloud requirements."
